            <p>As part of a collaborative group project during my second year at university, I played a key role in designing and developing a comprehensive web application.</p>
            <img src="img/Wrok1.png" alt="">
            <p>My responsibilities included:</p>
            
            <ul> <li><strong>Front-End Design & Development:</strong> I was responsible for designing and developing the front-end of the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By incorporating responsive design principles, I ensured the site was fully functional on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This improved the siteâ€™s usability across a wide audience, including conservationists and researchers. </li></ul>
            <ul> <li><strong>Wireframing & Prototyping:</strong> Using Figma, I developed detailed wireframes and prototypes to map out the user experience (UX) before we began coding. These designs helped the team and stakeholders visualize the final product, allowing us to make early adjustments based on feedback. My focus was on creating a clean, intuitive layout that simplified navigation while effectively presenting important data. </li></ul>
            <ul> <li><strong>User-Centered Design:</strong> The primary users of this application were expected to be non-technical conservationists. Therefore, I prioritized ease of use and accessibility throughout the design process. I ensured that critical features, such as species search, data filtering, and record updates, were prominent and easy to interact with, minimizing the learning curve for users. </li></ul>
            <ul> <li><strong>Responsive & Interactive Features:</strong> I implemented key interactive features, such as search filters and dynamic content loading, using JavaScript and React. These features allowed users to quickly find relevant information and interact with the system efficiently. I also used CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to speed up development and ensure consistent design. </li></ul>
            <ul> <li><strong>Collaboration & Agile Methodology:</strong> Throughout the project, we followed Agile development practices, conducting sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. My role involved not only working on the front-end but also collaborating with the back-end team to integrate the user interface with our SQL-based database. I handled the smooth transfer of data between the client-side and server-side, ensuring accurate data retrieval and submission. </li></ul>
            <ul> <li><strong>Testing & Quality Assurance:</strong> To ensure that the site was robust, I participated in usability testing and debugging, focusing on identifying and fixing potential issues that could affect user experience. I tested the web app across different browsers and devices to ensure cross-platform functionality and addressed any compatibility issues. </li></ul>
            <ul> <li><strong>Final Outcome:</strong> The project was a resounding success, receiving an A* grade for both technical execution and design quality. Our application was praised for its user-friendly interface, seamless performance, and effective presentation of complex information. The experience provided me with valuable insights into full-stack web development and collaborative project management, skills I continue to refine. </li></ul>
            <p> This project was an excellent opportunity to collaborate in an Agile environment, where we adhered to sprint cycles and practiced continuous improvement. The project was successfully delivered on time, achieving high grades for both its technical functionality and its user-focused design.</p>
